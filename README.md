# EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE CLUSTERING
A simple implementation of the Euclidean Distance Clustering algorithm in Python that allows to cluster your data using the euclidean distance and also prints the distance matrix for each epoch of the algorithm. 

The program reads the data by a .csv file and plots a dendrogram and a radar plot of the final result. 

## Install the dependencies
To install the project dependencies just run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Script usage
To run the script just run the command ```python main.py``` and follow the instructions: type the file name in the folder to be read and the number of clusters to be created.
